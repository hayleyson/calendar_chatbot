      "For Microsoft Outlook:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Open Outlook and go to the Calendar section.\n",
      "2. Switch to the \"Week\" or \"Work Week\" view to see the days side by side.\n",
      "3. Use the date navigator to move two weeks ahead to the Monday.\n",
      "4. You should now see all the scheduled events for that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Apple Calendar:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Open the Calendar app.\n",
      "2. Click on the \"Calendars\" button to ensure all relevant calendars are checked.\n",
      "3. Use the arrow buttons or the mini-calendar to navigate two weeks ahead to the specified Monday.\n",
      "4. The day's schedule should now be displayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'd like to create a list manually for a future date, simply calculate the date two weeks from the coming Monday. From today's date, count fourteen days forward (which covers two weeks), and then identify the first Monday following that date. \n",

      "\n",
      "### Before the Contest:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Preparation (Early in the Week)**\n",
      "1. **Practice Sessions:** Schedule daily practice sessions for your singing, focusing on the songs you'll be performing. Make sure you're giving your voice enough rest between sessions, so aim for short, focused practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Song Selection:** Finalize your song choices early in the week to ensure you have time to practice them thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Outfit and Accessories:** Decide on what you'll wear during the performance and prepare any accessories or props you might need. Ensure everything fits comfortably and allows you to perform without restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Technical Requirements:** If the contest requires music tracks, microphones, or other technical elements, make sure you have these prepared in advance and have backups in case something goes wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Closer to the Event (End of the Week)**\n",
      "5. **Dress Rehearsal:** Have a full dress rehearsal with your final outfit and practice using the microphone or any instruments to simulate the performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Feedback Session:** Perform in front of friends or family members for feedback. If possible, record your performance and review it to see where you can improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Voice Care:** Take care of your voice. Avoid straining it, stay hydrated, and perhaps even avoid dairy or other foods that can affect your vocal quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Relaxation Techniques:** Stress can affect your performance, so incorporate relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga into your daily routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Day Before the Contest:\n",
      "9. **Pack Your Bag:** Prepare a performance bag the day before with everything you will need, such as your outfit, copies of your music, water bottle, throat lozenges, a towel, and any other personal items.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Early Night:** Get an early night's sleep to ensure you're well-rested for the big day.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Day of the Contest:\n",
      "11. **Healthy Breakfast:** Start with a good breakfast that will give you sustained energy without weighing you down.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Voice Warm-up:** Do a light vocal warm-up in the morning and a more comprehensive one closer to your performance time.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Arrival at Venue:** Aim to arrive at the venue early to familiarize yourself with the stage and settings, do a sound check, and settle any nerves.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. **Final Preparation:** Use the time before the performance to focus, go through your songs in your mind, and calm yourself with your preferred relaxation technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. **Positive Mindset:** Maintain a positive attitude, visualize your success, and go into the performance with confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### During the Contest:\n",
      "16. **Stage Presence:** Remember to connect with the audience, smile, and enjoy the performance. Your stage presence can be just as important as your singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. **Technical Aspects:** Pay attention to the sound cues and try to be adaptable if something unexpected occurs during your performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### After the Contest:\n",
      "18. **Cool Down:** Do some light vocal exercises to cool down your voice if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. **Evaluation:** Regardless of the outcome, assess what went well and areas for improvement for future performances.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. **Celebrate:** Take a moment to celebrate the effort and courage it took to participate, no matter the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement this plan, start by adding these items to your calendar with specific times, so you have a clear schedule to follow. Adjust based on any additional personal obligations or specifics of the contest. Remember, it's important to take care of your mental and physical well-being in preparation for a performance. Good luck with your singing contest!\n",
